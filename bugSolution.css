The corrected CSS uses a more robust approach to ensure consistent centering across browsers. Instead of relying only on flexbox for vertical centering, it uses `min-height` for the container and makes sure the content is also a flexbox to avoid potential issues with content height.
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
