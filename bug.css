The following CSS code snippet causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers.  The `.container` class is intended to center its contents both horizontally and vertically, but the centering is inconsistent across different browser versions and rendering engines.  
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.content {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
